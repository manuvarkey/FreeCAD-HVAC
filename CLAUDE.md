# Project development rules

These rules govern how code is written and tested in this repository. They
are deliberately narrow — do not expand their scope beyond what is written
here.

For an overall picture of how the pieces fit together and execute (layers,
end-to-end sync/execute flow, type-selection subsystem), see
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) before making structural changes.

## 1. Unit test policy

Unit tests are required for data-structure generation/maintenance modules
**and** for geometry-handling code (loading, dispatch, port/property
handling). They are **not** required for the actual geometry-generation
code inside library parts, which is still in an exploratory/testing stage.

**In scope for unit tests:**

*Data structure generation/maintenance:*
- `freecad/HVAC/core/Network.py`
- `freecad/HVAC/core/NetworkParser.py`
- `freecad/HVAC/core/FlowNetwork.py`
- `freecad/HVAC/core/Segment.py` / `freecad/HVAC/core/Junction.py` (data/state handling, not shape generation)
- `freecad/HVAC/core/AirflowSolver.py`, `freecad/HVAC/core/DuctSizer.py`, `freecad/HVAC/core/airflow.py`

*Geometry handling (loading, dispatch, property/port handling — not shape construction):*
- `freecad/HVAC/library/Library.py` — type-def loading/registry, `resolve_params`, backend dispatch in `build_geometry`
- `freecad/HVAC/library/validation.py` — property validation
- `freecad/HVAC/library/static_shapes.py` — descriptor loading, placement transform, port validation
- `freecad/HVAC/library/partscript_shapes.py` — module loading/caching and `generate()`/`validate()` contract checking (not the PartScript's own geometry code)
- `freecad/HVAC/library/library_api.py` — property/port/context helpers only: `vec`/`xyz`/`unit`/`angle_between`/`average_point`, `center_from_context`, `connected_ports`, `port_*` accessors, `copy_port`, `build_trim_rec_from_*`, and the loss-orchestration methods (`elbow_loss`, `transition_loss`, `branch_loss`, `manifold_loss`, `terminal_component_loss`, `inline_device_loss`)

**Out of scope for unit tests** (geometry generation inside library parts —
still in testing/exploratory stage, do not write tests for these):
- Any `generators/*.py` module inside a library (e.g. `smacna/generators/segments.py`)
- Any PartScript model file under a library's `models/*.py`
- `freecad/HVAC/library/template_shapes.py` — an FCStd-template shape-generation primitive, used the same way a generator uses `make_straight_shape`
- The shape-construction primitives in `library_api.py`: `make_profile_frame`, `make_line_edge`, `make_wire_from_edges`, `make_rectangular_wire`, `make_circular_wire`, `make_oval_wire`, `make_section_wire(_from_port)`, `make_section_face(_from_port)`, `make_straight_shape`, `make_curved_shape`, `make_pipe_shell`, `make_loft`, `line_wire`, `arc_wire`, `fuse_shapes`, `shape_from_fcstd`
- Any other code whose job is producing/assembling `Part.Shape` geometry

If it's unclear which bucket a module or function falls into, ask before
adding tests — do not default to writing (or skipping) tests based on
guesswork.

## 2. Naming convention

The library naming convention documented in
[`freecad/HVAC/libraries/README.md`](freecad/HVAC/libraries/README.md) is
the single source of truth and must be followed everywhere a type is named,
including PartScript files.

- **Segments**: `<profile>_<shape>` (e.g. `circular_straight`, `oval_straight`, `rectangular_straight`).
- **Junctions**: `topology_family_sub_classification`, where `topology` is
  one of `through`, `branch`, `cross`, `multiport`, `end` (must match the
  parser's classifier vocabulary), `family` is the specific fitting family
  (omit it if the type is generic across the whole topology), and
  `sub_classification` is `generic`, `marker`, or a backend name (reserved
  for `samples`).

**This naming convention also applies to PartScript files** (`models/<name>.py`)
and any other per-type model file (`.FCStd`, descriptor `.json`, `.step`) —
the file name must match its type-def `id` exactly, so a type-def, its
PartScript/model file, and any generator entry point all use the same name.
See "Model file naming" in
[`freecad/HVAC/libraries/README.md`](freecad/HVAC/libraries/README.md) for
the full rule, including the shared-model-file exception.

Do not invent alternate naming schemes for new segment/junction types or
model files. If a new case doesn't fit the documented convention, raise it
rather than improvising.

## 3. General development guidelines

- **Respect the layering** described in the root `README.md`: network
  container (`Network.py`) → topology/parsing (`NetworkParser.py`) →
  generated objects (`Segment.py`/`Junction.py`) → library layer
  (`Library.py`/`library_api.py`/JSON type-defs). Don't reach across layers
  (e.g. don't hardcode fitting-specific logic into `NetworkParser.py` when
  it belongs in a library type-def).
- **New segment/junction types are added as library data** (JSON type-defs
  + a geometry backend), not by hardcoding new cases into core modules. Core
  code should stay generic across library-defined types.
- **External/library code uses only `HVACLibraryAPI`** (`library_api.py`)
  rather than importing internal HVAC modules directly — this is documented
  as the stable public surface for generator/PartScript authors.
- **New geometry backends aren't invented ad hoc.** Use one of the three
  documented mechanisms (PartScript, static BREP/STEP, legacy generator
  function) — see `freecad/HVAC/libraries/samples/README.md` for how to
  choose between them.
- **Follow the existing library directory layout** (`generators/`, `models/`,
  `types/segments/`, `types/junctions/`) for new library content even though
  it isn't hardcoded — every shipped library follows it.
- **Match the existing SPDX/LGPL file header** on new Python files (see any
  existing module under `freecad/HVAC/` for the exact block).
- Keep changes scoped to what's asked — this project is early-stage and
  under active restructuring, so avoid speculative abstractions or
  refactors bundled into unrelated changes.

## 4. Code comments

This project comments more than the general default minimal style: the
goal is for someone reading a module for the first time to follow what's
happening without having to reverse-engineer it from the code alone.

- Write comments in plain, simple English — avoid dense, jargon-heavy
  prose. Explain it the way you'd say it out loud to a colleague, not the
  way you'd write a spec.
- Keep comments concise: 1-2 lines is normally enough for a given point.
- Beyond function/class docstrings, add short inline comments marking the
  logical steps of a non-trivial multi-step function (e.g. "Step 1: ...",
  "Step 2: ...") so its process flow can be followed without tracing the
  code line by line.
- Still explain the *why* behind non-obvious decisions (hidden constraints,
  invariants, workarounds) — simplify the wording, don't drop the
  substance.
- This is a repo-wide style. When substantially editing a module, bring its
  comments in line with this style rather than leaving old dense/cryptic
  ones sitting next to new ones.

## 5. Rule stability

Do not modify this file, or otherwise change the rules above, without
explicit instruction to do so. Encountering a case these rules don't cover
is not sufficient grounds to edit them — flag it instead.
