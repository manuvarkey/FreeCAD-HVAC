"""
Standardized construction-layer vocabulary.

A duct/fitting's wall can be built from any number of physical layers (a
bare sheet-metal wall, a wall plus insulation wrap, a wall plus an acoustic
fill plus a perforated liner, ...). Library authors invent their own layer
*ids* ("casing", "liner", "absorber", ...) and decide how many layers a type
has and how they're geometrically built -- that recipe lives entirely in
library JSON/generator code (see Library.py's "construction" type-def block
and the profiles, sweeps, lofts, and booleans in library_api.py).

What core owns instead is the semantic *role* vocabulary below: the fixed,
standardized set of physical roles a layer can play. Downstream code
(materials, appearance, and later airflow/acoustic/thermal/detailing) must
only ever branch on a layer's roles, never on its library-chosen id -- that's
what keeps core/application code generic across arbitrary library-defined
constructions.

This module is pure data -- no FreeCAD import, same "library/core-neutral"
convention as geometry_result.py -- so it can be imported from both
library/ (type-def loading, geometry backends) and core/ (the construction
query facade) without pulling in FreeCAD.
