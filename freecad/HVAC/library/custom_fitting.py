"""
Custom fittings (ROADMAP 6.3): fitting a user-modelled fitting, described
by its own ports, onto a network node. Pure math with numpy, no FreeCAD.

A custom port is a frame in the fitting's own coordinates: an origin at the
centre of the opening, `z` pointing out of the fitting, `x` along the width
of a rectangular or oval opening. A duct port is the network's: every duct
of a node starts at the node point and runs along its outward `direction`.

`fit()` finds which custom port goes on which duct, the rigid placement that
puts every custom port on its duct's centre line pointing along it, and how
far out along each duct the port lands (its trim).
