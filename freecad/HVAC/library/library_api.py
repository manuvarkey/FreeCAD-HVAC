"""Stable public helpers and geometry primitives for HVAC libraries.

Library generators and PartScripts receive this class as
``context["hvac_api"]``. The API is grouped from low-level, non-shape
helpers through direct Part geometry operations to HVAC-specific convenience
recipes. Library code must use this surface instead of importing FreeCAD,
Part, or internal HVAC modules directly.
