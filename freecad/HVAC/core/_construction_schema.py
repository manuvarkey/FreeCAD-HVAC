"""
Dynamic per-layer/per-feature property bookkeeping for FreeCAD objects whose
construction (how many layers/features, what each is called) depends on a
selected library type (DuctSegment, DuctJunction's DuctComponent children).
Sibling of core/_type_schema.py's apply_type_schema() -- same add/remove-
stale-properties pattern, but for the Layer_<id>_Shape/Layer_<id>_Material
pair every construction layer gets, and the Feature_<id>_Shape every
construction feature gets, instead of ordinary declared properties.
Internal to core/ -- not part of the stable library_api.py surface for
library/generator authors.
