"""
The semantic construction query API: a read-only view of one DuctSegment/
DuctComponent's own construction layers, queryable only by standardized
role (see library/construction.py's ROLE_* vocabulary) -- never by a
library-chosen layer id. This is the one seam downstream modules (airflow/
sizing hydraulic roughness, acoustic calculations, thermal calculations,
duct detailing/fabrication) are meant to read construction through, so they
stay generic across whatever arbitrary layers a library type declares.

FreeCAD-aware adapter (reads a real object's own Layer_<id>_Shape/
Layer_<id>_Material properties -- see core/_construction_schema.py -- plus
the resolved type-def's own declared roles), the same role
core/_analysis_adapter.py plays for the analysis layer. Internal to core/ --
not part of the stable library_api.py surface for library/generator authors.
