CustomLossCoefficients slot, and how those user-supplied K values turn into
a LossEvaluator (see analysis/model.py's LossEvaluator type and
analysis/loss.py's LossPath/LossEvaluation). Kept separate from
_analysis_adapter.py (which stays a thin "read the real FreeCAD object"
layer) per the repo's own "small, cohesive modules" convention.

Also owns remap_persisted_edge_keys(), the shared old-key -> new-key
translation core/Network.py applies to CustomLossCoefficientEdgeKeys on
every sync -- the same carry-forward mechanism already used for
DuctComponent.AttachedEdgeKey, extended here to custom-K storage so it
survives a document reload instead of being silently reset to 0.0 by this
module's own "fail clearly on a real mismatch" validation below.
