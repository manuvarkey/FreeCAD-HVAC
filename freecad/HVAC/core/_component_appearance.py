"""
Renders every construction layer's own Layer_<id>_Shape with its own native
Layer_<id>_Material (Materials::PropertyMaterial -- see utils/materials.py
and core/_construction_schema.py), plus every construction feature's own
Feature_<id>_Shape, on a single ViewProvider/FeaturePython object, using
FreeCAD's own native per-face appearance mechanism instead of a custom Coin
scene graph:

    Step 1: Shape is always Part.makeCompound([layer shapes in
            obj.ConstructionLayerIds order, then feature shapes in
            obj.ConstructionFeatureIds order]) (see core/_geometry_apply.py).
            Each Layer_<id>_Shape/Feature_<id>_Shape is one of the very
            shapes that compound was built from, so
            len(Layer_<id>_Shape.Faces)/len(Feature_<id>_Shape.Faces) is
            the compound's real, exact per-layer/per-feature face
            partition -- not a guessed or hardcoded split.
    Step 2: build one appearance entry per face, walking layers then
            features in those same declared orders -- each layer's own
            faces get its own Layer_<id>_Material's appearance. A feature
            has no material of its own (see core/_construction_schema.py);
            it visually inherits its host layer's own appearance when
            "visible" (per its own visible_parameter, if declared),
            otherwise a fully-transparent override -- the mechanism behind
            "hide a feature without regenerating geometry": the feature's
            visible_parameter is marked Prop_NoRecompute (see
            core/_construction_schema.py), so changing it re-fires this
            module's updateData() trigger without ever touching Shape.
    Step 3: assign that per-face list to ViewObject.ShapeAppearance (the
            native per-face App::Material list FreeCAD >= 1.0 renders
            with).

Best-effort throughout: an unassigned/unrecognized material never raises,
it just leaves that layer's faces at FreeCAD's own default appearance.
