"""
Works out airflow and pressure drop for a whole NetworkModel -- a pure port
of core/AirflowSolver.py's algorithm.

flow.solve_flow_components does the first part: splits the network into
independently-solvable trees and works out how much air moves through each
segment (see that module for the balancing-terminal/conservation model).
This module takes it from there, per segment/node:
  1. From a segment's own section and flow, work out its velocity, Reynolds
     number, and straight-duct friction loss (Darcy-Weisbach).
  2. At each node, work out its fitting/dynamic loss -- each node's Primary
     component (and, independently, each edge's own Inline chain) supplies
     its own loss_evaluator (built by the FreeCAD adapter from the actual
     library type -- this module never resolves one itself); if none is
     given, a generic fallback coefficient is used instead.
  3. Add the losses up (kept separate as friction/junction/component so
     paths.py can report them separately) and propagate static pressure
     outward from the balancing terminal (fixed at 0 Pa as the reference).

Pressure-reference convention (Phase F/G below): static pressure decreases
in the flow direction. static_pressure[node] is the node's own fitting
body reference point -- taken BEFORE any of its legs' own turning/
branching loss is subtracted (Phase F derives each node's own static
pressure by subtracting/adding the FULL edge loss, itself already
including that leg's own pressure_drop_pa, one step further out). A
LossPath's Pa contribution is always attributed onto its own
reference_edge_key's segment (see resolve_loss_evaluation() below) -- this
is already direction-agnostic-correct at the node/JunctionResult level for
both a diverging fitting (loss on its outlet legs) and a converging one
(loss on its inlet legs). What does depend on direction is a single port's
OWN static pressure (ComponentPortResult.static_pressure_pa, Phase G): a
port that is its own path's to_edge_key is downstream/outlet (pressure
drops crossing the fitting toward it, so subtract), while a port that is
its own path's from_edge_key is upstream/inlet (pressure is higher there,
before the fitting absorbs the loss, so add).
