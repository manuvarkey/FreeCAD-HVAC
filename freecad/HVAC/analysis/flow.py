"""
Works out how much air flows through every segment of a NetworkModel. Both
pressure.py (pressure/loss) and sizing.py (duct dimensions) need this same
answer before they can do their own, separate calculation, so it's solved
once here and shared -- a pure port of core/FlowNetwork.py's algorithm,
operating on NetworkModel instead of a live FreeCAD document.

How it works: each connected sub-network must be a tree (no loops). Exactly
one open end (terminal) is left with no Design Flow Rate -- that's the
balancing terminal (e.g. the fan/AHU connection), and its flow is whatever
makes everything else balance. Every other terminal has a user-set design
flow rate (e.g. a diffuser). Starting from the terminals and working inward
towards the balancing terminal, each segment's flow is just conservation of
mass: flow out of a junction equals flow into it. A segment's own fixed flow
direction is read from its ports (flow_into_node).

A sub-network that isn't a tree (has a loop) is reported as an error rather
than solved.
