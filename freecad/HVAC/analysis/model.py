"""
Pure data model for the analysis/ package: plain dataclasses describing one
network's engineering-relevant state (sections, ports, components, nodes,
segments) and settings (air state, sizing settings). Nothing here knows about
FreeCAD -- every object is related back to a real FreeCAD document object by
a stable string id (an edge_key or node_id) rather than a direct reference,
so analysis/ never has to import core/, library/, or utils/hvaclib. Building
one of these from a real DuctNetwork is core/_analysis_adapter.py's job;
turning a solved/sized one back into FreeCAD property writes is the job of
the solver-specific adapter (core/AirflowSolver.py, core/DuctSizer.py).
