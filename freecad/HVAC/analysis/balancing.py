"""
PressureBalanceCoordinator: sits on top of a base sizing strategy (default
LocalStaticRegainSizer -- but any SizingStrategy-shaped object with a
.size(network, components, settings) method works, so a future
EqualFrictionSizer/ConstantVelocitySizer could reuse this same layer) and
iteratively narrows the pressure-loss gap between sibling branch paths.

Deliberately compact, not a general optimizer: each iteration re-solves the
whole network's pressure/paths (analysis.pressure/paths), finds the
terminal whose path has the largest pressure_deficit_pa relative to the
critical path, and shrinks the single most-upstream segment unique to that
path (the one right where it branches off the critical path) by a fixed
step, which adds friction and so reduces the deficit. Repeats until every
path is within settings.balance_tolerance_pa of the critical one, a fixed
iteration cap is hit, or a path can't be shrunk any further (its velocity
would exceed a practical ceiling) -- at which point its remaining deficit
is reported as an explicit BalancingRequirement (e.g. "fit a damper here"),
rather than forcing an unrealistic duct size to close it.
