"""
Geometry smoke run: build every junction type of the shipped libraries
against a set of simple synthetic nodes, and report what came out.

This is not a unit test (shape construction is out of scope for those, see
AGENTS.md). It is a quick way to see, in a real FreeCAD, whether a change to
the fitting generators broke any type, profile or node layout:

    python tools/geometry_smoke.py                 # list problems + a summary
    python tools/geometry_smoke.py --all           # list every build
    python tools/geometry_smoke.py out.json        # also save the full report as JSON

`python` here is the Python that ships with FreeCAD (on Windows,
`bin/python.exe` in the FreeCAD folder). With any other Python of the same
version, set FREECAD_BIN to FreeCAD's `bin` folder first. The script always
builds with the code of the checkout it lives in, even when another copy of
the addon is installed in FreeCAD's Mod folder.

Compare two saved reports (before/after a change) to see what moved. For
each build the report holds: valid/invalid, total volume, per-layer volume,
and the trim length returned for each port. A type's separate trim-measurement
function is also run and must give the same trims as its build.
